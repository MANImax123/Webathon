Problem Description: 
When I'm working on a group project, I don't just want to know if my code compiles. 
I want to know if we're actually making progress, if we're all on the same page, and 
whether we're building something we'll be proud of when demo day arrives. 
But most of the time, that bigger picture is fragmented. One teammate is pushing 
commits at midnight. Another hasn't updated their branch in three days. Someone's 
stuck on a bug but hasn't mentioned it. The WhatsApp group is full of "I'll do it later" 
and "wait, who's handling auth?" You check GitHub and see commits, but commits 
don't tell you the story. You don't know if someone's refactoring the database or just 
fixing typos. You don't know if that "small feature" mentioned in chat is actually 
holding up the entire frontend. 
In fast-moving student projects like hackathons, capstones, semester-long builds, 
there's no project manager. There are no stand-up meetings. There's just a WhatsApp 
group, a shared repo, and a lot of assumptions about who's doing what. Over time, 
this creates chaos like duplicate work, missed deadlines, features that don't integrate, 
and that sinking feeling two days before the deadline when you realize half the team 
thought someone else was handling deployment. 
What student teams need isn't another linter. It's a project command center, a real
time dashboard that shows progress, surfaces blockers, tracks contributions, and 
keeps everyone aligned so you can spend less time being confused and more time 
building something that actually works.
